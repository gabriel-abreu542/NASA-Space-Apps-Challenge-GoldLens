# 🌌 GoldLens — NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025

## 🪐 Introduction

**GoldLens** is a project developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**, under the challenge **“A World Away: Hunting for Exoplanets with AI.”**  
The project’s primary objective is to design and implement an artificial intelligence solution that supports the detection of **exoplanets** using **publicly available astronomical data**.

The solution integrates a **Python backend** with a **modern web frontend**, enabling users to evaluate and apply machine learning models through an accessible and interactive interface.  
GoldLens seeks to connect **advanced data science** with **astronomy** while promoting **open collaboration** and **scientific discovery**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

GoldLens delivers an **end-to-end pipeline** for research in exoplanet detection.  
Users are able to:

- Ingest and preprocess astronomical datasets (e.g., telescope light curves)
- Evaluate performance using recognized statistical metrics

The system also provides a **web-based interface** where predictions can be tested, explored, and visualized in real time.

By combining **scientific rigor** with **accessibility**, GoldLens serves both as a **research tool** and an **educational platform**, designed to ensure **transparency**, **usability**, and **collaboration** — contributing to the **democratization of space research**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
├── artifacts # Trained ML artifacts
├── model.pkl # Serialized model ready for predictions
├── backend/ # Python server (training, prediction, API)
├── datasets/ # CSV datasets used for training and testing of the model
├── frontend/ # React + Vite web application
├── modelo.py # Model training and serialization
└── README.md # Documentation

Observation: We suggest the use of clean data for the analysis by the model (tests can be made with the "CANDIDATE" lines of the "clean_K2" and "clean_KOI" datasets). An improved version of the software was used applying Tansfer Learning on the TOI dataset, along with the former K2 and KOI datasets, and could deal with "dirty", unprocessed data, utilizing a robust preprocessing pipeline. However, due to problems on the integration of the model constructed with the web application, it could not be included on time for the project submiission for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025.
